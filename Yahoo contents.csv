Two months before she dropped the news that she’s expecting her first child with Elon Musk, Grimes (aka Claire Boucher, who now legally goes by c, the symbol for the speed of light), lit up music Twitter. The one-time neuroscience major let loose with a provocative forecast on theoretical physicist Sean Carroll’s Mindscape podcast when she shared, “I think live music is going to be obsolete soon,” predicting we might be seeing the last generation of human artists and also inspiring dozens of variations on the same joke suggesting Grimes’ own imminent obsolescence. In Grimes’ defense, she was referring to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), an AI that’s as powerful as human intelligence in every way and is expected to arrive any time between the next decade and never and is currently unmatched by any AI tool on the market or in the works. However, even looking into the music landscape’s hazy future, “obsolete” is a strong word.  A few musicians publicly responded, including Holly Herndon, who made her own AI songwriting tool for last May’s PROTO , which was released as part of her dissertation for Stanford’s Ph.D. program in Computer-Based Music Theory and Acoustics, plus a series of since-deleted tweets from Zola Jesus and another thread from Grimes’ ex-boyfriend, Majical Cloudz’s Devon Welsh. Grimes may be correct about AGI being technically better at making art and music, much like Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo executed creative, never-before-seen strategies to beat the world’s best Go player. But, that won’t stop people from making music about their lived experiences, a feat AGI won’t be capable of credibly undertaking on its own. Editors' Picks  Setting aside AGI and focusing on the current AI songwriting tools aimed at the music industry, to a large degree these tools open up new opportunities for musicians rather than threatening to replace them. One notable exception, a point Cherie Hu made in an article for SongTrust last year, is production music. These songs are intended to create a vibe or provide an emotional backdrop geared toward licensing for film, TV, and commercials. Creators behind this particular medium are primed to struggle under the weight of the new entrants targeting easily reproducible styles of mood-heavy music, like JukeDeck, a UK-based AI music startup that was recently acquired by TikTok and can “interpret video and automatically set music to it.” Emerging music technologies of the recent past have been unable to live up to the threat-level hype. Drum machines, samplers, sequencers, synthesizers — these have been field-levelers, not death knells, opening doors to allow more people to participate in writing, recording, and performing music rather than shutting creators out. Backing bands aren’t losing gigs to loop stations; instead, we get visionary creativity like tUnE-yArDs looping the hell out of “Bizness”, and bad singers aren’t displacing any talented vocalists in the wake of Cher pioneering Auto-Tune as the vehicle for her transcendently pitch-corrected cyborgian break-up anthem, “Believe”. AI tools are unlikely to be markedly different, at least that’s how it looks from this side of the singularity. Rather than replacing biological creators or pushing anyone out, AI might just expand the field for new entrants for the foreseeable future, creating opportunities for those for whom making music was to some degree inaccessible (for instance, hits can now be written and produced on iPhones), and in some cases, pushing artists and music into completely new creative territory. David Bowie paved the way for AI-powered songwriting in the early 1990s, teaming up with Apple for Verbasizer, a proto AI lyric assistant that used Bowie’s own lyrics in a kind of digital cut-out technique that randomized sentences, which he used on his 1995 album, Outside. Today, we have Lyric AI, “a collaboration between Reimagine.AI and Google Brain building an artificial intelligence assistant designed to help musicians create original lyrics.” Google’s DeepMind has an AI project that generates “speech which mimics any human voice” called WaveNet, so we’re approaching an AI that can actually handle vocal duties. Facebook’s Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) team is building their own AI system on top of WaveNet, attempting to develop a music translation AI system that can transform a hummed or whistled tune into a complete song. Google isn’t only building tools for lyrics and vocals; the tech behemoth also has a variety of AI songwriting tools under the umbrella of open-source research project Google Magenta, including NSynth, a neural synthesizer that uses a deep neural network to learn the characteristics of sounds and uses the original sounds’ acoustic qualities to synthesize new sounds. In fact, Grimes herself used NSynth on her forthcoming album Miss_Anthropocene. Another Google Magenta project is Piano Genie, an intelligent controller that maps 8-buttons of input to a full 88-key piano in real time, which The Flaming Lips tweaked to make Fruit Genie, with its physical interface consisting of fruit; yet another is MusicVAE, which blends musical loops and scores. YACHT’s August release, Chain Tripping, was composed using MusicVAE on every track. French songwriter Benoît Carré wrote “Daddy’s Car”, the first song written with the help of artificial intelligence using a songwriting tool made by Sony Flow Machines. The tool emulates a specific style of genre, in this case, mimicking The Beatles. Together, they created the first AI album, Hello World (2016), under the moniker SKYGGE (Danish for “shadow”), actually landing a track on Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist. Spotify later poached the head of Sony Flow Machines, François Pachet, for Spotify’s Creator Technology Research Lab in July of 2017, so not only can Spotify use AI for music discovery and distribution, but they can now also utilize AI to write their own songs (which might make record label execs unhappy but will probably be used to make the rest of us as happy as possible). Another album written in collaboration with AI is I Am AI, the 2018 debut album by former American Idol contestant Taryn Southern using a combination of Amper, which lets you create and rework stems, and IBM Watson Beat, which uses a combination of reinforcement learning and neural networks to create tracks; and Alex da Kid used IBM Watson Beat on “Not Easy”, which was a Top 40 hit in 2016. Both IBM Watson Beat and Google Magenta are open source on GitHub, making it easy for developers to access, and while Amper seems available to musicians, judging from its use on Southern’s I Am AI, it’s actually aimed at “enterprise teams” creating “stock music” en masse with sliding prices dependent on “team size and specific music needs.”  AI-powered songwriting assistant Amadeus Code is available as an iPhone app (free, $1.99 pay as you go, or $9.99/mo), while ambitious Aussie start-up Popgun (one-time presumptive slayers of the Top 40 hit, currently providing an app for “teenagers using AI tools to make music for one another”) is focused on creating a space for “pop stars on training wheels.” Popgun’s Splash is newly available as a free iPhone/Android app, just coming out of beta in mid-December. Also recently out of beta, where it was most popular with gamers creating diss tracks to send to their vanquished enemies over Discord, is an extremely simple AI “songwriting” tool, Boomy, available via a web-based interface (free or $8.99/mo versions available). Amazon Web Services (AWS) just announced their entrant into the field, AWS DeepComposer, last month at their AWS re:Invent conference in Vegas, which offers “the world’s first machine learning-enabled keyboard for developers.” Arca just announced her AI collaboration with Bronze AI (which Jai Paul also demoed), and AI composer tool JAM is a new entrant set for release in March of 2020. Tons of music-related start-ups are popping up globally (Music Ally published a report last November detailing some of the most interesting), including WaveAI, creators of Alysia, a “lyric assistant” and “melody partner” complete with AI-generated vocals; HumTap, which converts a hummed tune into full instrumentation that you can add beats to and set to a video; UK start-up Vochlea, which takes vocalizations (even beatboxing) and turns it into MIDI accessible in various digital audio workstations (DAW) that can be used to create a full song; and Greek creators of an AI “beat assistant” at Accusonus. Who knows what will be announced next, but for now, most musicians’ jobs don’t seem to be going anywhere. If we’re “nearing the end of human-only art,” as Grimes later clarified on Twitter, then it’s a period ripe for hybrid creativity. It’s already happening — the tools exist right now and enterprising musicians are currently using them in creative ways. This will only increase as more tools become available and more musicians experiment with them, ushering in a new phase of creative expression that incorporates an ever-evolving AI tool set that enables musicians to more fully express our humanity.

The robot has a humanoid face, hands and lower arms, which gesticulate with what could pass for passion as it bounces up and down and rotates during the live performance of Keiichiro Shibuya's opera ""Scary Beauty"" in the Emirate of Sharjah. For Shibuya, a composer from Japan, the role of robots in our everyday lives may well be increasing, but it is up to us to decide how artificial intelligence might add to the human experience, and humans and androids create art together. ""This work is a metaphor of the relations between humans and technology. Sometimes the android will get crazy, human orchestras have to follow. But sometimes humans can cooperate very comfortably,"" he said. Shibuya wrote the music, but the android controls the tempo and volume of the live show, and even sings at times. ""The premise is that the android itself is moving according to its own will,"" said its technician Kotobuki Hikaru. The work's lyrics are based on literary texts from American ""Beat Generation"" writer William Burroughs and French author Michael Houellebecq. ""The robots and AI that exist now are not at all complete. The focus of my interest... is what happens when this incomplete technology comes together with art,"" said Shibuya. From those who witnessed it, the performance drew a mixed response. ""I think this is a very exciting idea...we came to see how it looks like and how much is ...possible,"" said Anna Kovacevic. A second audience member, who gave his name only as Billum, said after the show: ""You know, a human conductor is so much better."" Although he is interested in AI and anticipates big breakthroughs, he concluded on the project: ""the human touch is lost.""

2,https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-bjork-microsoft-ai-lobby-score-soundtrack.html,"I sat in the lobby of the Sister City hotel in downtown New York City, laying back on a comfy couch, breathing as deeply as I could. Bjork stayed here for a month last year. I thought that maybe if I breathed hard enough, I could absorb some of her essence. It's a surprisingly unassuming setting for Kórsafn, the ""generative audio experience"" that the Icelandic musician created in partnership with Microsoft and Sister City. There are no displays, no laser beams, no smoke machines. If you didn't know about the installation, you might miss it. At the right time of day, this lobby could be a quiet respite from New York's unceasing hustle. But the sound installation -- or in Sister City's words, its new ""lobby score"" -- takes it a step further and transports you (not literally) to a transcendent realm. The relative peace and stillness in the lobby was punctuated at random moments by haunting choral voices from overhead speakers. Every few seconds, heavenly high notes rang out, followed by deep, booming chants, altogether sounding like a horde of ghosts playing a taunting game of choral peekaboo. Of course, it's not supernatural. It's Microsoft's AI using feedback from a camera installed on the hotel's roof to determine which of Bjork's selected works to play. ""Kórsafn"" translates to ""choral archives,"" and fittingly it features snippets drawn from the musician's favorite arrangements of her career, performed by Iceland's Hamrahlid Choir. Even as disjointed chunks, the vocal clusters sounded otherworldly, lending an ethereal air to the space.  Microsoft used what it calls an automated, long-term AI-training algorithm to understand weather trends via the streaming camera and detect things like snow, rain, clouds, clear skies and even bird flocks. The AI is even smart enough to distinguish among types of clouds, like cumulus or cirrus, according to Microsoft Director of Strategic Partnerships Amy Sorokas. It decides which vocal clusters to play depending on what's overhead. When the sun is shining, for example, the AI plays higher-pitched clusters. Since I was there in the evening, I heard more low tones than someone there during an afternoon listening session would have. In the lobby, you can't tell or even imagine what might be crossing the rooftop camera's line of sight. All you get are the clusters of voices that ring out of the speakers overhead, and the effect is almost unsettling. It's not something you'd expect to hear in a hotel lobby, but this is by design. Those in the know, like the roomful of media on opening night, might find it fun to try to guess what triggered the sound. Hotel guests who haven't been briefed, however, might be confused. ""For me, the interesting thing is exciting this notion of curiosity,"" Sorokas said. ""Like, wondering what made that sound happen but not explaining it so totally that people feel like, 'I know exactly what's happening.'"" It is this sense of wonderment that she believes makes a difference. ""It kind of makes you relax a little bit if you let yourself, just let your mind wander.""  Ryan Bukstein agreed. He's the Vice President of Brand for Atelier Ace, which runs Sister City, and he believes that the score offers an unexpected environment that jolts visitors' awareness. ""Every time you walk into a space now, you hear playlists,"" he said. ""We wanted to score, because it really helps take people out of their normal of what they're used to hearing."" This isn't the first time a custom score has been designed for a hotel or a restaurant, of course. Composer Ryuichi Sakamoto has made original music for museums and buildings before, even using light and wind sensors to change the music during the day. The hospitality industry has also opted for unique soundtracks over generic playlists, though those are still composed of individual tracks. It's not even Sister City's first time doing something like this: Its inaugural score launched with its opening last year, featuring work from experimental electronic musician Julianna Barwick. Yet Kórsafn is still an unconventional experience that manages to be enjoyable. I only sat in the lobby for about half an hour, which is far longer than most guests might, and though some of the motifs eventually felt slightly repetitive, the voices of the choir left me feeling relaxed. Each time a different vocal cluster played, I wondered if a bird had flown by -- or, since this is rat-infested New York City after all, whether a rodent had skittered past the camera. Though that's a chilling thought, the otherworldly sounds helped make the city's grit feel far away. I could listen to this soundtrack all day, as it's exactly the unobtrusive type of background noise I need to work. It's mostly due to the style of music, but the randomness of the AI generation also keeps things from getting boring and becoming a lullaby. The lobby is open to the public, and you can hear the sounds from the adjacent hotel bar, so if you're a big Bjork fan looking for a nice space to work out of, this could be worth checking out. Kórsafn will run through the end of the year, so you have plenty of time to listen to what a teamup between AI and Bjork sounds like. If you're not likely to be in New York City before then, you can still check out the soundtrack and watch the rooftop camera's feed on Sister City's website.","Sentiment(polarity=0.09510339885339883, subjectivity=0.4841166491166491)"

4,https://news.yahoo.com/beethoven-never-finished-last-symphony-170400811.html,"From Popular Mechanics Ludwig von Beethoven’s unfinished last symphony is being completed by artificial intelligence, Yahoo! reports. Beethoven died at age 56 in 1827. The work on his 10th and final symphony is part of a yearlong celebration of the composer’s 250th birthday on December 17, 2020. The decision to use AI is polarizing in the classical musical community, but Beethoven’s work in particular has been the subject of a lot of technological attention for decades. In 1824, Beethoven finished his legendary ninth symphony in D minor, the one that includes “Ode to Joy.” After that, he began work on a 10th symphony that wasn't just never completed—it’s so incomplete that scholars aren’t certain when partial drafts or sketches of musical ideas are even related to it. And efforts to complete it have also gone on for decades, causing uncomfortable arguments between prominent scholars. They compare it to Gustav Mahler’s similar unfinished 10th symphony, which has a fully orchestrated first movement and a complete entire draft in a simplified score form. Mahler’s work was completed by a musical scholar named Deryck Cooke, who studied Mahler all his career and felt able to extrapolate, with caveats, based on the extensive outline Mahler left. Far from composing or even orchestrating, he felt he was just building to a blueprint. “‘[O]rchestrate’ is not quite the right word here; Mahler conceived this music orchestrally, and his short scores are blueprints for instrumentation,” Cooke wrote. When this work is performed, Cooke’s involvement is prominently noted both as a credit and an explanation. In contrast, Beethoven’s final work is, in the literal and figurative senses, much more sketchy. Many scholars argue there just isn’t enough of Beethoven’s final symphony to complete it in a responsible way, with surviving sketches of only the first movement and no example of a fully orchestrated version. Cooke felt able to do justice to Mahler’s final work because he had examples of what he believed were Mahler’s whole vision for three of the five sections. For Beethoven’s 10th, there’s no such example. Germany’s national 250th birthday celebration for Beethoven has drawn fresh attention to the unfinished symphony, and the team’s project to “complete” the symphony is more of an experiment in AI composition with a Beethoven focus. Like the machine learning that scholars are using to sniff out the real William Shakespeare, these scholars have given their algorithm all of Beethoven’s works and used that to build a profile. From this, they ask the algorithm to analyze what little Beethoven left of the 10th symphony and extrapolate from there. It’s more of an abstract science experiment than, say, a cohesive yet still hotly debated Tupac Shakur hologram. Even previous human scholarly efforts to complete a draft of only the first movement of the symphony have been classified strictly as experiments, compared with the performable and reasonably respected Mahler 10th symphony synthesized by Cooke. So far, Beethoven scholars aren’t impressed. Barry Cooper, a world-renowned Beethoven expert who has sketched a complete first movement in the past, told Yahoo!, ""I listened to a short excerpt that has been created. It did not sound remotely like a convincing reconstruction of what Beethoven intended.” You Might Also Like","Sentiment(polarity=0.13914141414141415, subjectivity=0.5090728715728716)"
